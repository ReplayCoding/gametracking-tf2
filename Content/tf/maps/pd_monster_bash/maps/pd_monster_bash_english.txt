Objective:
Collect buckets of gibs from fallen enemies and deposit them into the central capture zone to score points. Points cannot be deposited when the central shield is active. The team with the most buckets deposited wins the game.

Other Notes:
Players with the most buckets on either team will radiate health and ammo to nearby teammates, but their location will be exposed to enemies.
