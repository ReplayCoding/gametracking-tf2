Objective:
To win, pick up beer from fallen enemies and deposit these into the UFO tractor beam to score points (to get the UFO drunk). Whoever has the most amount of beer on each team dispenses health and ammo to nearby teammates. 

Other Notes:
You can block an enemy team deposit by jumping into the beam while they try to deposit beers.
